      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;yes-sir-and-yes-maam&#34;&gt;Yes sir and Yes Ma&amp;rsquo;am&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to try Hugo for a bit now so I finally decided to give it a try. The security aspect of not having a lot of surface area where vulnerabilities can be lurking is very appealing as well as just having a quick, responsive website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, this will be my personal website where I will ramble about various things, mostly what I am studying.  Currently, I am studying for the Microsoft MS900.  Also, I want to be well acquainted with the CompTIA A+ material but am not sure if I am going to actually take the tests.  It might suffice to just be able to pass 7 or 8 practice tests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
